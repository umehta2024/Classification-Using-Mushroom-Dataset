# Classification-Using-Mushroom-Dataset
Author - Upasana Mehta
This is a dataset of different types of mushrooms and their features. Based on those features we can classify if the mushroom is edible or poisonous. 
The data set consists of 22 features (independent variables), 1 dependent variable and 8124 observations. The dependent variable has categorical charater
value - 'p'(poisonous) and 'e' (edible); hence, this is a classification problem. And since the number of classes is two, it is a binary-class classification.

After performing EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and creating test and train sets. I will be running 4 classification algorithms and my aim is to determine
which among these 4 classification models - Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree and KNN is a better performing model and is able to classify a mushroom
more accurately if it is edible or poisonous.
